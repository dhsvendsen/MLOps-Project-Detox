# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

>
> Answer:

Since our project is a NLP classification task, we utilized the Transformers framework from Huggingface. More specifically, we used the BertModel with pretrained weights. 

First we preprocess the data by stemming, lowering and removing stop words using functionality from NLTK. Then we tokenize the comments using the functionality from the BertTokenizer. The new dataset is split into test, train and validation sets and saved as a tensor. 

We then implemented a PyTorch NN model whose first layers are the BertModel with  frozen weights, followed by a trainable dense classification layer. As such, the Transformers framework helped us complete the project by effectively functioning as an embedding tool, whose outputs could then be classified with a simple linear layer. 

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**

>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

The first step would be to clone our repository from github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhsvendsen/MLOps-Project-Detox.git
```

This repository contains a set of docker images and a requirements file (`requirements.txt`). To get an exact copy of our environment, one could simply create a virtual environment and pip install the contents of `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
However, to assure complete reproducability, it is recommened to instead utilize the docker the docker images. One way would be to build the image locally using the `TrainerLocal.dockerfile` for the training, and `Simple_app.dockerfile` for the FastApi deployment. The images are stored on our Google Cloud Container registry. Simply pull the newest docker image:
```bash
docker pull INSERT PATH TO CONTAINER REGISTRY
```
and use this image to build a docker container.

> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

In our project we utilized branches in our workflow in order to be able to work on the project simultaneously. Each member had one or more branch(es) which the person worked on. 

To give an example, one branch (transformer_development) was dedicated to creating a make_dataset script, which transformed the raw data into tensors that the model could load during the training time. When this script was finished, we pulled from main into the transformer_develop and resolved any conflicts. We would then do one of two things: 

Either we used 'git checkout main' to merge the branches locally and then subsequently push to the remote main branch. At other times, we comitted the local changes on the developer branch and created a pull request to main. By accepting this pull request, the two branches were merged and the make_dataset script added to the main branch. Similarly, for the other parts of the project. The former approach is likely the more appropriate for a group project, whereas the latter is representative of how one would contribute to a larger project that one does not have full permission over.

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We used Hydra to keep track of our hyperparamters and thereby ensure reproducibility. An overall Hydra config file pointed to separate config files for each of the scripts related to the model: train, test and the model itself. These scripts initialize  by loading their respective config file, which sets hyperparamters such as the data paths and model paramers which in the case of the train script includes: 

pretrained_name: "bert-base-uncased"
lr: 0.001
n_epochs: 2 
batch_size: 32

Using Hydra to create config files ensures that these are easy to understand for people unfamiliar with the code, which makes the project more reproducable.


### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

When running experiments, we would log the hyperparameters in the config files along with the performance using W&B. Combining W&B and Hydra config files proved somwhat challenging.

We did not get Hydra and W&B to work in conjunction. However, in our personal projects we tracked experiments using W&B by setting a Sweep config over select hyperparameters. This can be thought of as running experiments, since we are determening which combination of hyperparameters leads to the best performance and how good this performance is. Alternatively, we could also just run training etc. on a specific set of paramters and track how the performance metrics change over epochs etc.

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We have developped two docker images for our project: one for training the model (INSERT LINK) and a second for deploying the model to a FastApi (INSERT LINK).

You can work with these images locally or through GCP.
      
To work locally you can take the dockerfiles from our github (as described earlier) and build and run these. As an example here is how you would use the docker image locally:
```bash
docker build -f simple_app.dockerfile . -t fastapi:latest
```
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8000 fastapi:latest
```
afterwards you can access the fastapi on localhost:8080
      
To run everything on GCP, you can use the existing image in our container registry to deploy the FastApi through `Cloud Run`:

```bash
gcloud run deploy gcp-test-app --image gcr.io/modified-wonder-374308/test_app:latest --platform managed --region europe-west1 --allow-unauthenticated --port 8080
```

You could then run/create a docker container:

```bash
Insert how to run docker container
```

Alternatively you could run everything in Google Cloud. Step one would be to run the training:

```bash
insert how to run training on GCP
```

Afterwards you could run the deployment using
```bash
gcloud run deploy gcp-test-app --image gcr.io/modified-wonder-374308/test_app:latest --platform managed --region europe-west1 --allow-unauthenticated --port 8080
```
